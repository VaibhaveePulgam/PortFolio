								<p>“Information is the oil of the 21st century and analytics is the combustion engine!” This quote by Max Levchin, co-founder of PayPal has always found a place in my curious mind that the mysteries in the world of big data are still unraveling. I have always been inclined towards the complexities posed by mathematics and was more than willing to try my hand at newer and more complicated problems. Working with data and making data driven decisions has always excited me to gain more knowledge and motivated me to work more in this domain. My immediate goal after master’s is to be a Data Analyst. In the long run I see myself becoming a Data scientist as I am hugely inspired by magic that data can show. Working in teams from my undergraduate degree has set me markers about striving for curiosity, team building, leadership, social and local problem solving. Apart from academics, I have been a part of many extra-curricular activities during my undergraduate. Having participated and managed various events has not only improved my decision making but has also made me patient and tolerant. I am a strong believer of ‘Hard work pays off’ so I made hard work as a part of my lifestyle. I am a motivated and curious engineer with demonstrated experience in Data Analytics domain. Experienced in exploratory data analytics, data visualization, developing ML algorithms and developing predictive models. I believe that I am a strong problem solver, extremely patient along with excellent communication skills. I am dedicated to exceeding goals and expectations. <a href="#work">awesome work</a>.</p>
